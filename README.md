# daily-programming

Readme by ChatGPT. Based on stuff I see on Twitter / X.

## Description
This repository serves as my personal programming playground. It's a collection of small projects, exercises, and experiments with different programming languages and techniques. Each folder represents a different challenge or concept I'm exploring, primarily to keep my skills sharp and familiarize myself with new programming syntax and ideas.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repo is to:
- Keep my programming skills fresh.
- Experiment with new concepts and languages.
- Provide a sandbox where I can freely test out ideas without any pressure.

## How to Navigate This Repository
- Each subdirectory is named after the concept or challenge it addresses.
- Within each subdirectory, you'll find the source files and a brief README explaining the specific problem or technique explored.

## Languages Used
I use various languages in this repository, depending on what I'm interested in or learning at the time. Examples include:
- Python
- JavaScript
- [Other languages you might experiment with]
